This is the program to replay real human movement trace. It works fine under large scale network. We try to record the mobility information as much as possible. The visiting frequence of each position, neighbor distribution, pause time distribution and flight distribution of each node are collected.

Based on this program, any application or routing scheme could be easliy evaluated.

My goal of this program is to look at how data flows based on real human mobility.
